# Hi, I'm Umar Mohammad üëã
 
üë®‚Äçüíª **Software Engineer** | üéì **Passionate Educator with a Touch of Humor** üòÑ 

### About Me
 
My journey with computers started in 4th grade when I first encountered one at a friend's house. It felt like magic seeing it instantly display anything I asked for, and that sparked my curiosity about how it all worked. My teacher‚Äôs advice to be good at math initially seemed like a bluff to make me study harder, but little did I know, it was the key to unlocking the world of programming! üìö

Fast forward to today, I‚Äôm the **first-generation software engineer** in my family. I‚Äôve built multiple software applications, earned a **full-tuition scholarship** for my bachelor‚Äôs in CS, and now support my master‚Äôs education by teaching programming as **Graduate Teaching Assistant** emphasizing the importance of math, which my younger self struggled to appreciate. üë®‚Äçüè´

### Recent Projects I Built

When I didn‚Äôt land a summer internship, I took it as an opportunity to focus on building some projects I had been planning for a long time. Here are two of the major projects I completed:

- [**Distributed File System**](https://github.com/umar-7w4/Distributed-File-Storage-System) ‚Äì A small-scale distributed file storage system built in Java, simulating real-world systems like Hadoop‚Äôs HDFS.
- [**Distributed Task Scheduler**](https://github.com/umar-7w4/Distributed-Task-Scheduler) ‚Äì A fault-tolerant and scalable system using Zookeeper for dynamic task assignment, ensuring reliability and recovery from worker failures.

### Other Cool Stuff I‚Äôve Done
- üß† Built an **image classification model leveraging swarm intelligence**.
- üîí Developed a **secure multithreaded chat application**.
- üíª I regularly solve problems on **LeetCode** and share my approaches on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umarmhd/)‚Äîfeel free to check out my posts!

### Outside of Work
When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me experimenting in the kitchen with **Middle Eastern and Italian dishes** mixed with **South Indian flavors**. To balance things out, I also enjoy **lifting weights** üèãÔ∏è.  

Let‚Äôs connect and explore how we can make an impact together! üåü
