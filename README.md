### Hi, I'm Umar, a Software Engineer and a Passionate Educator with a touch of humor. üòä

My journey with computers began in 4th grade when I first saw one at a friend's house. It felt like magic seeing it instantly display anything I asked for, sparking my curiosity about how it worked. My teacher‚Äôs advice to be good at math initially seemed like a bluff to push me to study harder. Little did I know, it was true! üìö

Now, as the first-generation software engineer in my family, I‚Äôve built multiple software applications and pursued a bachelor's in CS with a full tuition ride. Currently, I support my master‚Äôs education by teaching, emphasizing the importance of math in programming, something my younger self struggled to understand. üë®‚Äçüè´

Some recent things üòé I've done are:
- Small-scale distributed file storage system in Java
- An image classification model leveraging swarm intelligence
- A secure multithreaded chat application
- I also love solving problems on LeetCode and share my approaches on LinkedIn‚Äîcheck out my posts! üíª
- Currently working on a graph-based deep reinforcement learning model that predicts high-risk firms in a loan network.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy cooking Middle Eastern and Italian food with South Indian flavors and lifting weights to balance out my culinary indulgences. üçùüèãÔ∏è

Let‚Äôs connect and explore how we can make a difference together! üåü
